Sprite tiles are 8x8 pixels - this is just how the sprite are setup.

Screen tiles are 8*8 * 2.5 = 20x20 pixels.

The maze has 28x31 tiles.

Screen tiles are given in screen coordinates, which translate directly to the screen.

Conversion from tile coordinates to screen coordinates is based on the center of the screen tile.
Therefore Tile 0/0 is at 10/10 and Tile 1/1 is at 30/30.

Because the artifact tiles have to be displayed on the screen, they are zoomed by factor 2.5 in order fit.
