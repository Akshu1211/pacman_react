- ğŸ˜˜Extract makeGhosts
- ğŸ˜˜Try to remove GameInterface
- ğŸ˜˜Refactor store so that it doesnt get in the way
- ğŸ˜˜Make scatter mode work
  - ğŸ˜˜Warum geht der Ghost nicht von 1/7 nach 1/8?
  - ğŸ˜˜Warum geht der Ghost nach -1/28 statt bei 1/1 stehen zu bleiben?
  - ğŸ˜˜Warum geht die Anzeige kaputt?
  - Have different scatter goals per ghost
- ğŸ˜˜Prevent ghost from going backwards, buy excluding the back direction in the wayfinding frontier
- ğŸ˜˜Break up the CSS into many files
- ğŸ˜˜Add tailwind to remove hacks
- ğŸ˜˜useLocaleStore instead of useMemo
- ğŸ˜˜Make the game display cleanly on a MacBook
- ğŸ˜˜Have a backref from PacMan to Game to access timestamp
- ğŸ˜˜Extract Game.pills into Maze store
- ğŸ˜˜Fix the missing ways at 7/14 and 8/14
- ğŸ˜˜Turn AnimationTestPage into a GamePage that plays the game
- ğŸ˜˜Let the ghosts start in scatter mode
- ğŸ˜˜Implement individual ghosts behaviours in scatter mode
- ğŸ˜˜Ghosts general behaviour:
  - ğŸ˜˜At each tile they choose a new target tile to go toward.
  - ğŸ˜˜Then they inspect all neighbour tiles
  - ğŸ˜˜A tile that is in opposite direction is removed.
  - ğŸ˜˜Tiles in a wall are removed.
  - ğŸ˜˜From the remaining moves, the distance to the target is calculated. The closest one is chosen as the next tile.
  - ğŸ˜˜If there are multiple tiles with the same distance, the tiles are prioritized. Up is highest.
  - ğŸ˜˜Then the new direction is chosen towards the new tile
- ğŸ˜˜When the ghost reaches a position that would make it stand still, choose the first free direction that is not backward instead.
- ğŸ˜˜Make ghost#wayPoints a @computed value - dependent on tileCoordinates and targetTile
- ğŸ˜˜Fix chooseNextTile() / Found no candidate
- ğŸ˜˜Support tunnel
- ğŸ˜˜SShow ghost targets
- ğŸ˜˜Implement individual ghosts behaviours in hunt mode:
  - ğŸ˜˜Blinky: PacMan
  - ğŸ˜˜Pinky: The tile 4 tiles in front of pacman. Only if pacman is facing up, pinkys target is 4 tiles up and 4 tiles to the left.
  - ğŸ˜˜Inky:
    o ğŸ˜˜An intermediate tile is chosen. It is 2 tiles in front of pacman. Only if pacman is facing up, pinkys target is 2 tiles up and 2 tiles to the left.
    o ğŸ˜˜Then the vector from the intermediate tile to Blinky is rotated 180 degrees. This is inkys target tile.
  - ğŸ˜˜Clyde:
    o ğŸ˜˜When >= 8 tiles away from pacMan: Target is PacMan.
    o ğŸ˜˜When < 8 tiles away: Same tile as in scatter mode.
- ğŸ˜˜After 7 seconds, go to hunt mode. After another 20 seconds, go to back to scatter mode
- ğŸ˜˜Enable ghosts to through the tunnel
- ğŸ˜˜findNextTile: Always use waypoints[1] as the next tile instead of searching through waypoints
- ğŸ˜˜Let ghosts move slower in tunnel
- ğŸ˜˜Remove ghost.timestamp
- ğŸ˜˜When entering chase mode, ghosts turn direction 180 degrees
- ğŸ˜˜When entering scatter mode, ghosts turn direction 180 degrees
- When pac man dies
   - ğŸ˜˜let all ghosts pause
   - ğŸ˜˜wait 5 seconds
   - When pac man has some live left
      - ğŸ˜˜revive pac man
      - ğŸ˜˜reset the ghosts
   - When pac man lost all lives
      - Hide the ghosts and pac man and show "Game Over"

- When I go to the bottom directly after start, the maze moves around on the screen. Probably because of the target sprite outside the maze.

- Frightened Mode:
  - Ghosts show Frightened sprite
  - In each tile they choose a random direction that is not backward and not into a wall
  - They move slowly
  - During the last 2 seconds of being frightened they show a white and blue blinking sprite


- Let GamePage have controls to show waypoints
- Show ghost states
- Enable ghosts to leave the Box. This requires them to move between tiles. Probably a new state is required
